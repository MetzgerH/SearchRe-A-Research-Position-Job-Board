### Product Scope
This product will serve as a medium for university research faculty looking to fill research positions. This will be done by allowing faculty to advertise positions through the product using a faculty account. Faculty will then be able to review candidates who have applied for their posted positions. Students will be able to make accounts with their information, search for research opportunities, and apply to them. This product alleviates the issue of faculty who cannot always reach all students with related research interests by allowing them to view as many possible candidates as possible.

### A Note on Project Origin
This project was completed as part of a class at WSU. I have removed references to the class and professor to prevent plagiarism, at the request of the professor. Eventually, the class curriculum will change and I will likely re-add these references.
